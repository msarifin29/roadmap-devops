## Internet Protocols

**Internet protocols** are a set of rules that allow computers and other devices to communicate over the Internet. These protocols ensure that data is sent, received, and understood correctly between different systems. There are many types of internet protocols, each serving a specific purpose, such as transferring files, sending emails, or securing data. Understanding these protocols is important for making the internet work efficiently and securely. In this article we will see different types of internet protocol in detail.

As we discuss Internet Protocol (IP) is a set of rules that allows devices to communicate with each other over the Internet. It is like the address system used for sending data. Every device connected to the internet has a unique IP address that helps data know where to go and where it is coming from.

## IP Address

An **IP Address** represents an Internet Protocol address. A unique address that identifies the device over the network. It is almost like a set of rules governing the structure of data sent over the Internet or through a local network. An IP address helps the Internet to distinguish between different routers, computers, and websites. It serves as a specific machine identifier in a specific network and helps to improve visual communication between source and destination.
### Working of Internet Protocol

Step by step working of internet protocol:

- **Dividing Data into Packets**: When you send information over the internet, IP split it into small parts called packets. Each packet contains a piece of the data and the address of where it needs to go.
- **Addressing**: Every device connected to the internet has its own IP address. This address helps identify where the data is being sent from and where it should be delivered.
- **Routing the Packets**: As the packets travel across the internet, they pass through several devices called routers. These routers help direct the packets toward the correct destination, like how mail is sorted at different post offices.
- **Reassemble the Data**: Once all the packets arrive at the destination, they are put back together to recreate the original message or file.
- **Handling Missing Packets**: If some packets donâ€™t arrive, the system can request that they be sent again, making sure the complete data is received.

This process helps data move efficiently across the internet, no matter how far it needs to travel or how many networks it passes through.
### Need for Internet Protocols

The sender and receiver of data are parts of different networks, located in different parts of the world having different data transfer rates. So, we need protocols to manage the flow control of data and access control of the link being shared in the communication channel. Suppose there is a sender X who has a data transmission rate of 10 Mbps. And, there is a receiver Y who has a data receiving rate of 5Mbps. Since the rate of receiving the data is slow so some data will be lost during transmission. In order to avoid this, receiver Y needs to inform sender X about the speed mismatch so that sender X can adjust its transmission rate. Similarly, the access control decides the node which will access the link shared in the communication channel at a particular instant in time. If not the transmitted data will collide if many computers send data simultaneously through the same link resulting in the corruption or loss of data.
